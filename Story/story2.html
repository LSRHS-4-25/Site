  <h1>You Accept Jacksonville's Offer</h1>
 <br>
<p>You accept Jimmy's offer, and now have the number 1 overall pick. Jackson Davis
is the top prospect QB. You regroup with your colleagues and discuss the draft. They
at you for giving up the team's future (the 2019-2020 picks you traded to Jacksonville)
and suggest that You call the Seahawks and trade the pick.</p>
