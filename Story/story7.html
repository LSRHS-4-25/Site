  <h1>The Owner Gets on Your Case</h1>
 <br>
<p>Your owner finds out that you didn't try to get a higher pick. He says that if
  make a pick at seven or lower and don't make the 2018 playoffs, then you will be fired.
Do you take a risk and pick at 7, or do you call the Seahawks and trade the pick?</p>
