  <h1>You Tell Jacksonville to Call Again Later</h1>
 <br>
<p>You now have time to think about your decision. There are three players you could
draft. Jason Mack (DE) Max Gonzalez (RB) or Jackson Davis (QB). Davis is the top prospect
that you will only be able to draft if you accept Jacksonville's offer. Do you call
Jacksonville and tell them that you don't want the pick or do you wait for them to call</p>
