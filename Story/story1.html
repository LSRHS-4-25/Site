  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
 <br>
<p>It is Draft Day 2018! Your team, the Ravens, has the 7th overall pick after
  finishing 2017 9-7 and barely missing the playoffs. There are two players that
  considering picking at 7. Jason Mack, a Defensive End from Georgia Tech is a good
  option, but you could also take Maurice Gonzalez, a Tight End out of USC. It is
  7:30 AM when you recieve a call from Jimmy Lawson, the GM of Jacksonville, who
  has the number one pick. He offers to trade you the number 1 overall for your
  seventh overall in 2018, your first round pick in 2019, and your second round
  pick in 2020. The number one overall could get you Jackson Davis, a Quarterback
out of Alabama who is said to be the best QB in the draft since Peyton Manning in 1998</p>
