  <h1>You Decline Jacksonville's Offer</h1>
 <br>
<p>You decline Jimmy's offer, and still have the number 7 overall pick. The owner
hears that you declined an offer for number 1, and he threatens to fire you. You
calm him down, and tell him that trading the 7th pick is never off the table. He says
you should call Seattle and make a trade for their number 3 overall. You must decide
between keeping your team's future, or making a trade for short term benefits.</p>
