      <h5>the character of an individual viewed as a member <br> of society;

    <p>Citizenship is important both on an international level, locally
      in your own community, and even digitally online. I believe that honesty, compassion,
      respect, responsibility, and courage are necessary traits in a good citizen because
      in order to earn the kindness, and loyalty of other people, you must be kind and considerate
      to them also. On this site, you will learn the importance of citizenship in all aspects of life.

    <h6> More on Citizenship </h6>
    <p> Being a good citizen online is important because, if everyone feels safe online,
      the internet can be a place where people can work, play, and grow happily. Being willing
      to listen is another trait of a good citizen. willingness to listen is important because you
      must listen to, consider, and respect other points of view online as well as in real life to
      ensure that people will do the same to you.</p>
    <p> <strong> Citizenship IRL: </strong> </p>
    <p> To be a good citizen online, one must be a good citizen in real life also. Treating
      people with compassion is important, and respecting other people, even those you don't know,
      can help to make the world we live in better. </p>
