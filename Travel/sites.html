 <p> If you are looking for a day trip during your stay in Charleston, enjoy Charleston's many beaches and shops
 located in and around the city. Another option is to visit Charleston's Forts and learn about our city's rich history.
A day trip that I would highly recommend is a visit to Boone Hall Plantation. Boone was the set for many famous
movies such as Gone With the Wind and Forrest Gump which were both filmed on the famous "moss road"
named for the spanish moss that coats the trees. The plantation is home to the Charleston Slave Museum,
where visitors can learn about the hardships of being a slave in the 19th century. Take a tour of the
Boone mansion and fields and explore the beautiful gardens in front of the home.</p>
